# LaPa-Dataset
## Introduction
we develop a high-efficiency framework for pixel-level face parsing annotating and construct a new large-scale **La**ndmark guided face **Pa**rsing dataset (LaPa). It consists of more than 22,000 facial images with abundant variations in expression, pose and occlusion, and each image of LaPa is provided with a 11-category pixel-level label map and 106-point landmarks.
